				Dr. Muhammad Yunus is renowned for his concept of the <strong>"Three Zeros"</strong>— <strong>Zero
					Poverty</strong>, <strong>Zero Unemployment</strong>, and <strong>Zero Net Carbon Emissions</strong>.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>1. On Zero Poverty:</strong>
				"We can put poverty in the museums of the future. It has no place in the twenty-first century."</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>2. On Zero Unemployment: </strong>
				"Human beings are not job seekers. They are job creators by nature. We just need to create a system that
				unleashes their entrepreneurial spirit."</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<strong>3. On Zero Net Carbon Emissions: </strong>
				"Businesses must be designed to solve problems, not create them. Social business can lead us to a world with
				zero net carbon emissions."
